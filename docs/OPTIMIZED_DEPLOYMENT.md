# Optimized Docker Deployment Guide

This guide explains the optimized deployment strategies implemented to speed up Docker builds and deployments to AWS.

## Overview

The original deployment process was slow due to:
- Large Docker images (1-2GB)
- No layer caching between builds
- Slow network uploads to ECR
- Sequential builds

The optimized process reduces deployment time from **20-30 minutes** to **5-10 minutes** through:
- Docker BuildKit with advanced caching
- AWS CodeBuild for cloud-based builds
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Parallel builds and smart caching

## Quick Start

### Fastest Local Build

```bash
# Build and deploy backend only
./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh backend

# Build everything
./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh all

# Use AWS CodeBuild (recommended for slow connections)
USE_CODEBUILD=true ./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh
```

### GitHub Actions (Automatic)

Deployments happen automatically when you push to GitHub:
- Push to `main` → Deploy to production
- Push to `develop` → Deploy to staging
- Pull requests → Run tests only

## Architecture

### 1. Optimized Dockerfiles

**Key improvements:**
- Multi-stage builds with target stages
- BuildKit cache mounts for pip/poetry
- Minimal final images (python-slim)
- Smart layer ordering for better caching

```dockerfile
# Example: Backend Dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.4

# Dependencies cached separately
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache \
    poetry install --only main --no-root
```

### 2. AWS CodeBuild

Build Docker images in AWS to avoid slow uploads:

```bash
# Trigger CodeBuild
USE_CODEBUILD=true ./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh

# Monitor build
aws codebuild batch-get-builds --ids $BUILD_ID
```

**Benefits:**
- Builds run in same region as ECR
- Persistent Docker layer cache
- No upload bandwidth needed
- Parallel builds

### 3. GitHub Actions

Automatic deployments on every push:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- Build and test on PR
- Deploy to staging on push to develop
- Deploy to production on push to main
- Manual deployment via workflow_dispatch
```

### 4. Docker Buildx

Advanced caching with buildx:

```bash
# Local and registry cache
docker buildx build \
  --cache-from type=registry,ref=$ECR:buildcache \
  --cache-to type=registry,ref=$ECR:buildcache,mode=max \
  --cache-from type=local,src=/tmp/.buildx-cache \
  --cache-to type=local,dest=/tmp/.buildx-cache,mode=max
```

## Usage Guide

### Deploy Everything

```bash
# Traditional (slow)
./scripts/deployment/deploy.sh

# Optimized (fast)
./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh
```

### Deploy Specific Components

```bash
# Backend only
./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh backend

# Lambda functions only
./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh lambda

# Admin frontend only
./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh admin-frontend
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Using GitHub Actions (recommended)
git push origin main

# Manual with CodeBuild
ENVIRONMENT=production USE_CODEBUILD=true ./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh

# Manual local build
ENVIRONMENT=production ./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh
```

## Performance Comparison

| Method | Time | Bandwidth | Notes |
|--------|------|-----------|-------|
| Original Docker build | 20-30 min | 2-3 GB upload | No caching |
| Buildx with caching | 10-15 min | 200-500 MB | Local cache |
| AWS CodeBuild | 5-10 min | ~10 MB | Cloud build |
| GitHub Actions | 5-8 min | 0 (automatic) | Best for CI/CD |

## Caching Strategy

### Layer Cache Hierarchy

1. **Registry cache** - Shared between all builds
2. **Local cache** - Persistent on build machine
3. **BuildKit cache** - In-memory during build
4. **S3 cache** - CodeBuild persistent cache

### Cache Invalidation

Caches are automatically managed but can be cleared:

```bash
# Clear local buildx cache
docker buildx prune -f

# Clear registry cache (careful!)
aws ecr batch-delete-image \
  --repository-name harness \
  --image-ids imageTag=backend-buildcache

# Clear CodeBuild cache
aws s3 rm s3://harness-codebuild-cache/backend --recursive
```

## Troubleshooting

### Slow Builds

1. **Check cache hits:**
   ```bash
   # Look for "CACHED" in build output
   docker buildx build --progress=plain ...
   ```

2. **Use CodeBuild for slow connections:**
   ```bash
   USE_CODEBUILD=true ./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh
   ```

3. **Verify buildx is enabled:**
   ```bash
   docker buildx ls
   ```

### Build Failures

1. **Clear caches and retry:**
   ```bash
   docker buildx prune -f
   ./scripts/deployment/fast-build.sh
   ```

2. **Check AWS credentials:**
   ```bash
   aws sts get-caller-identity
   aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin
   ```

3. **Review CodeBuild logs:**
   ```bash
   aws codebuild batch-get-builds --ids $BUILD_ID
   ```

### GitHub Actions Issues

1. **Check secrets are configured:**
   - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional)

2. **Review workflow runs:**
   - https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/harness/actions

3. **Manual trigger:**
   - Go to Actions tab → Deploy workflow → Run workflow

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Appropriate Build Method

- **Local development**: Use buildx with local cache
- **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions
- **Slow internet**: Use AWS CodeBuild
- **Quick fixes**: Deploy specific components only

### 2. Optimize Dockerfiles

- Order commands from least to most frequently changing
- Use specific version tags (not `latest`)
- Minimize layers in production stage
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files

### 3. Monitor Costs

AWS CodeBuild pricing:
- $0.005 per build minute (general1.small)
- $0.01 per build minute (general1.medium)
- S3 storage for cache

Optimize by:
- Using appropriate instance sizes
- Setting cache expiration
- Building only changed components

### 4. Security

- Use IAM roles, not access keys
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Keep base images updated
- Use specific image tags in production

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Build Arguments

```bash
# Development build with hot reload
docker buildx build --target development ...

# Production build with optimizations
docker buildx build --target production \
  --build-arg PYTHON_OPTIMIZE=2 ...
```

### Parallel Builds

```bash
# Build multiple services concurrently
parallel -j 3 ::: \
  "./fast-build.sh backend" \
  "./fast-build.sh lambda" \
  "./fast-build.sh admin-frontend"
```

### Blue-Green Deployment

```bash
# Deploy new version without downtime
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster harness-cluster \
  --service harness-api \
  --deployment-configuration \
    maximumPercent=200,minimumHealthyPercent=100
```

## Monitoring

### Build Metrics

Track build performance:
- Build duration
- Cache hit rate
- Image size
- Upload time

### CloudWatch Dashboards

Monitor deployments:
- CodeBuild success rate
- ECS deployment status
- Lambda update duration
- CloudFront cache hit ratio

### Alerts

Set up notifications for:
- Build failures
- Deployment issues
- Cost anomalies
- Security vulnerabilities
